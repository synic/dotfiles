synic's dotfiles
================

My dotfiles, excluding my vim or spacemacs configurations, which are in their own repositories:

- https://github.com/synic/dotvim
- https://github.com/synic/dotspacemacs

### NOTE

This repository has been reset, and now uses yadm. If you are looking for my old repository, it 
has been moved to https://github.com/synic/dotfiles-legacy

### Installation:

To use, install yadm (`brew install yadm` on MacOS), and then type
the following:

```bash
$ yadm clone https://github.com/synic/dotfiles
```

This will clone the repository and automatically create symlinks for all 
tracked files in their proper locations in your home directory.
